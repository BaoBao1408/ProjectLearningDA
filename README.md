## 🏢 Project 1: Istanbul Shopping Mall Development Potential

📌 Objective

Evaluate the potential for business development and customer investment across shopping malls in Istanbul, based on detailed purchase behavior, geography, and customer segmentation.

📊 Key Steps

Analyze geographic location of malls and urban population density

Clean and process shopping data from 99,457 transactions (2021–2023)

Segment customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling

Analyze product trends by age, gender, category, and payment method

Evaluate revenue and invoice trends by location and over time

🧠 Insights

Mall of Istanbul generated highest revenue (≈51M USD)

Promising customers (35.5% of base) contributed over 50% of total revenue

Middle-aged women (40+) drive highest purchasing power

Fashion & Cosmetics lead in revenue; Toys & Shoes in quantity

Strong seasonality: peaks in Q1 and Q4; drops in Q2 and Q3

📂 Tools

Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)

Power BI (for customer segmentation, RFM visuals)

Geo maps and visual dashboards

📅 Outcome

Location-based investment guidance, product targeting strategies, and priority customer segments for maximizing profitability in Istanbul's retail landscape.

## 🏥 Project 2: Predict Customer Purchase Behavior

📌 Objective

Build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a customer making a purchase based on demographics and behavioral data.

📊 Key Steps

Data loading & preprocessing (missing values, duplicates)

EDA: customer age, income, product preferences

Modeling: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC

🧠 Insights

Loyalty Program, Discounts, and Time Spent on Website strongly influence purchasing

Younger age groups (<30, 41–50) show higher purchase behavior

Random Forest achieved highest AUC: 0.95

📂 Tools

Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook

📅 Outcome

A high-performing classification model and strategic recommendations for e-commerce optimization.

## 📞 Project 3: Google Fiber – Repeat Call Analysis

📌 Objective

Analyze repeat customer calls to identify service issues, recurring trends, and recommend operational improvements for Google Fiber.

📊 Key Steps

Monthly trend analysis (Jan–Mar)

Day-of-week repeat call patterns

Market vs. call type segmentation

Root cause hypothesis and validation

🧠 Insights

March showed a call spike requiring investigation

Call Type 5 and Contacts N1 had highest repeat rates

Market 2 underperformed compared to others

✅ Recommendations

Improve handling of Call Type 5

Investigate March spike & Contacts N1 group

Optimize support operations in Market 2

📂 Tools

Google Slides (Data Viz), Excel/Sheets, Business Analysis

📅 Outcome

Operational insights, executive-level recommendations, and a root-cause summary for improving call center effectiveness.
